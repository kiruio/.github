# Kirui
A personal archive for our software projects and experiments.

This organization serves as a structured repository for a variety of development efforts, primarily involving full-stack applications and language exploration with **Rust**, **Kotlin**, and **TypeScript**.

## Project Scope
The repositories here represent a spectrum of work:
- Production-grade utilities and libraries.
- Learning experiments and proof-of-concepts.
- Archived projects for future reference.

## Notes
This is a personal workspace made public for transparency and archival purposes. Projects are developed according to our own needs and timelines.
